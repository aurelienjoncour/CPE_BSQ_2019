# Subject
You must find the largest possible square on a board while avoiding obstacles.
The board is represented by a file passed as the program’s argument. The file is valid if it is respecting those
constraints:
- its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),
- “.” (representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for the
other lines,
- all of the lines are of the same length (except the first one),
- it contains at least one line,
- each line is terminated by ‘\n’.

You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
